# The project

CryptoBridge is a Dapp that manages fund raisings in blockchain based of the CryptoBridge Smart Contract. One can create a fund raising with an identification and others can donate and leave a message. Later, the owner of the fund raising can withdraw the funds. As well, a fund raising can be opened and closed by its creator when they prefer.

Built in Solidity, this project can be deployed to any EVM Blockchain.
